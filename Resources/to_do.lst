#Killswitch & Improvements for OpenVPN

# PRIORITIES
############

REVIEW:	https://github.com/gjedeer/nordvpn/issues/1
MID:	'recommender' can find nordvpn servers that are unofficial?!?
LOW:	'recommender' currently only works for NordVPN
HIGH:	grab the top-recommended server and prepare to connect
		ping to see if it's online? or is that already built in?
HIGH:	need to make connect and disconnect useful
		integrate the native openvpn commands (they also share variables for udp/tcp)
			offer ipv4 & ipv6 support
MED:	for some reason you cannot connect to a vpn if 'vswitch on' was activated. need to allow connection during firewall or, at least, prioritize command properly
LOW:	should i offer to restore hosts file during uninstall?




# COMPLETED
###########
make a 'panic' function to shut down all traffic on all ports/protocols/etc
check the names of the "custom_hosts", "solus_hosts", etc when ive determined if debian needs a custom hosts
still having issues with the dependencies check on the install script
i want a 'status' command to see if the vswitch is enabled or not (use ifconfig to grep)
on the 'enable' command i need a failsafe to check that 'sudo ifconfig' is using 'tun0'
make function run as a command - still need autocomplete for arguments/options
test that the autocompletion works even when i dont manually source the /etc/bash*.d/vswitch directly into terminal (not via scripting)
does debian use `nmcli`?
MID:	run a check to see if the 'panic' command is properly active
	# completed via fn_check_connectivity
LOW:	the `hosts` command is not properly interpretting the $2
	# fixed a number of $2 handling
LOW:	allow user to save their $VPNUSERNAME if they so wish (need to provide user notice that this may be a security risk)
	# use $1 'user"

I could use an alias to mean something like: ./startkillswitch.sh
	id have to make the alias permanent
	or i could make an actual linux command/service
	
ufw Uses "+" as a wildcard instead of "*". This is why the script defaults to "tun+"

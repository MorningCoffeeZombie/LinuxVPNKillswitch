#Killswitch & Improvements for OpenVPN

# PRIORITIES
############


MID:	'recommender' can find nordvpn servers that are unofficial?!?
LOW:	'recommender' currently only works for NordVPN & public
LOW:	'recommender' is grabbing the lowest recommended server
LOW:	should i offer to restore hosts file during uninstall?
LOW:	IPv6 is unsupported
MID:	Need to escape the content/vars pulled from conf file
WISH:	Offer onion/tor routing
			Review:	https://linuxaria.com/howto/how-to-anonymize-the-programs-from-your-terminal-with-torify
			Review:	https://github.com/susmithHCK/torghost
HIGH:	'connect' relies on 'recommend' which relies on being able to query Nord's API. Without query results the user cannot connect to vpn if 'vswitch on'
MID:    sourcing in the autocomplete script is not working via script (user must manually enter it)




# COMPLETED
###########
make a 'panic' function to shut down all traffic on all ports/protocols/etc
check the names of the "custom_hosts", "solus_hosts", etc when ive determined if debian needs a custom hosts
still having issues with the dependencies check on the install script
i want a 'status' command to see if the vswitch is enabled or not (use ifconfig to grep)
on the 'enable' command i need a failsafe to check that 'sudo ifconfig' is using 'tun0'
make function run as a command - still need autocomplete for arguments/options
test that the autocompletion works even when i dont manually source the /etc/bash*.d/vswitch directly into terminal (not via scripting)
does debian use `nmcli`?
MID:	run a check to see if the 'panic' command is properly active
	# completed via fn_check_connectivity
LOW:	the `hosts` command is not properly interpretting the $2
	# fixed a number of $2 handling
LOW:	allow user to save their $VPNUSERNAME if they so wish (need to provide user notice that this may be a security risk)
	# use $1 'user"
HIGH:	grab the top-recommended server and prepare to connect
	ping to see if it's online? or is that already built in?
MED:	for some reason you cannot connect to a vpn if 'vswitch on' was activated. need to allow connection during firewall or, at least, prioritize command properly
		this is 'sorta' fixed...need to play around a little bit more with `ufw allow openvpn`
		turns out all i needed was `ufw allow out openvpn`
HIGH:	need to make connect and disconnect useful
		integrate the native openvpn commands (they also share variables for udp/tcp)
			offer ipv4 & ipv6 support
		The issues with `openvpn` command are due to NMCLI being the proper overlay for connections. Use `nmcli c up file.ovpn --ask` to connect
HIGH:	Make sure adding username via nmcli isn't borked
MID:	Optional storage of username is unsupported

I could use an alias to mean something like: ./startkillswitch.sh
	id have to make the alias permanent
	or i could make an actual linux command/service
	
ufw Uses "+" as a wildcard instead of "*". This is why the script defaults to "tun+"

Users needing to run a VPN such as OpenVPN or WireGuard will need to adjust the DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY variable in /etc/default/ufw from a value of "DROP" to "ACCEPT" for proper VPN operation.
App profiles are stored in /etc/ufw/applications.d and sometimes /etc/services

#Only needs to be run the first time after install:
$ ufw enable

#Same with this settings adjustment:
sudo nano /etc/default/ufw
#Then set "IPV6=yes" (no quote marks)

$ ufw logging off

$ sudo ufw allow openvpn

# LOG DUMP:

sudo ufw status verbose
nmcli general status
nmcli general logging level
curl icanhazip.com
speedtest --simple --secure

.SH "NAME"
	\fBvswitch\fR - disable all non-tunneled connections as a failsafe in the event of VPN disconnect.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
	\fBvswitch [options] [arguments]\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
 	\fBvswitch\fR is a lightweight manager for, VPN provider specific, OpenVPN connection settings. \fBvswitch\fR, when enabled, blocks all outgoing un-tunneled communications. Default tunnel is tun0. The state of \fBvswitch\fR's firewall is persistent through reboot - you will need to run \fBvswitch off\fR each time you wish to deactivate the killswitch regardless of system shutdowns.

.SH "ESCALATED TUNNELING"
\fBvswitch protocol udp\fR
\fBvswitch\fR allows users to immediately cut all connections (tunneled or not) with it's commands. To reestablish unfiltered connections users must de-escalate in the proper order.
.TP
This was done as a security measure to allow termination of running programs before immediately regressing to an untunneled state. Below is the escalation pyramid with the safest settings at the top and least safe at the bottom.

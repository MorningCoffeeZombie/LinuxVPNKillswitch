#Killswitch & Improvements for OpenVPN
######################################


# PRIORITIES
############

make a good hosts file
need copyright on 'man' page
i want a 'status' command to see if the vswitch is enabled or not
make an 'uninstall' command to remove my killswitch
on the 'enable' command i need a failsafe to check that sudo ifconfig is using 'tun0'
need to make connect and disconnect useful
make function run as a command - still need autocomplete for arguments/options

I could use an alias to mean something like: ./startkillswitch.sh
	id have to make the alias permanent
	or i could make an actual linux command/service





Make a separate widget to modify hosts file and block ad/spam traffic
	location: /etc/hosts

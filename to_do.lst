it seems like the function isn't accepting parameters right now
by declaring variables before the function, it may be wiping them everytime the function is run?
need copyright on 'man' page
i want a 'status' command to see if the vswitch is enabled or not
on the 'enable' command i need a failsafe to check that 'sudo ifconfig' is using 'tun0'
need to make connect and disconnect useful
make function run as a command - still need autocomplete for arguments/options
check the names of the "custom_hosts", "solus_hosts", etc when ive determined if debian needs a custom hosts

I could use an alias to mean something like: ./startkillswitch.sh
	id have to make the alias permanent
	or i could make an actual linux command/service
